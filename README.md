# Stakeholder Analysis

For our stakeholder analysis, we first identified all the project stakeholders and then used the influence-impact grid to prioritize stakeholders with the greatest values so we can meet their needs based on their standing on the grid. In this method, we referred to the influence as the stakeholder’s ability to control the project decisions and impact as the stakeholder’s ability to change the result of the project.

 We went further to develop our stakeholder map by placing the level of influence on the y-axis, impact on change on the x-axis and rating each identified stakeholder’s influence and impact on a scale of 0 to 10. This provided more insight on the stakeholder management approach needed to meet the unique needs all stakeholders on this project.

 The diagram below shows the stakeholder map:
